                    services and other Christian religious activities. We begin our church services with a ring of a bell.
                    The service usually involves the singing of hymns, reading of scripture verses and possibly a psalm,
                     and a sermon. If the church follows a lectionary, the sermon will often be about the scripture lections
                      assigned to that day.</p>

                <p class="text-muted" > A school library is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a
                      public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is
                       to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information,
                        and to information technology. School libraries help students to get authentic information through the books written
                        by reputed scholars who come from different parts of the world. A library plays an important role in 
                        creating a school culture, which helps every student to grow on their individual basis as well. Researchers have
                         demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies
                          that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that
                           students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist,
                            scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted 
                            in Ohio revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs
                             helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia
                              in 2003.</p>

                <p class="text-muted" > A school auditorium is large room with rows of seats and often a stage which is used
                     for performances or meetings. It is used for all types of formal assembly: lectures, award ceremonies,
                      dramatic plays, musical theatre productions, concert performances of dance competitions and so on.
                       These varied events place a range of demands on the room. Basically it  is a room built to enable an audience
                        to hear and watch performances.</p>
